I am an incoming master's student in the University of Washington's Mechanical Engineering department. I have gained practical experience in the field of mobile robotics by working in startups and research labs.

Currently, I am collaborating with Dr. Subhankar Mishra at the National Institute of Science Education and Research to conduct research on 3D reconstruction of sacred archaeological sites using 3D Gaussian splatting.

I am a movie enthusiast, a Formula One fan, and passionate about building aircraft. If you have any ideas related to my interests and would like to collaborate, please reach out.
